# 4W's Snapchat Username Checker

### This tool can be used to check the availabillity for snapchat usernames.
#### Tool was made using snapchats web API

This tool generates a new XSRF token per request this results that the tool will never ratelimit, and you can use big lists. Although you do need proxies for the tool to work.

### HOW TO USE:

* Download the files
* Install python 3.7
* Install the python modules (pip install [modulename])
* Insert username list to usernames.txt
* Insert proxies list to proxies.txt
* A discord webhook function was added, you can use this by removing the comments on the `sendWebhook` function on line 90, and adding your webhook URL on line 23.
* Click the run.bat file
* Wait until program is finished
* Open available.txt, for a list of available usernames


### Extra:
I have a discord on my github (4W#2100), But I will not provide any support for this tool since its a free tool.
My discord is only for clients or people seeking to become my clients. I can make any sort of tool.

If you like the project, then you should follow me and star this project, then I will release more tools.
